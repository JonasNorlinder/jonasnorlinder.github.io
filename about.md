Been hacking on computers for as long as I can remember, but I have been told that already at the age of three my parents could find me looking for fuse boxes because I wanted to "see how it works". Luckily, I survived that phase, and a PhD (to be completed soon) in execution environments for high-level programming languages. I work now in the Java Performance team at Oracle.
